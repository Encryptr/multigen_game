# Conquest of Our Ancestors

A mirror for the open-source grand strategy game. Currently in open beta: many flaws, but still a very solid foundation for the game engine.

## This Repo

For now, this page is simply a backup of documentation for the game. You will find docs, licensing, assets, and pointers to the real code.

## Link

You may view the anonymous port of the game at [https://www.themathjester.com/encryptr-coa](the Lead Dev's personal website) or by requesting access to the [https://gitlab.com/chozorho/conquest/](anonymous gitlab repo).

## License

The code is licensed underthe GPLv2 ~~until the lead dev writes his own license~~.
